This project was made to showcase my frontend proficiency in HTML and CSS. Most of the actual calculations were made possible through Java Script's eval() function. The downside of using this function is that eval() allows you to execute a string of code as if it were actual JavaScript code. This function should be limited to learning purposes and not any actual production code.

This was project was made possible through helpful walkthroughs by https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez
